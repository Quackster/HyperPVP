			<h4>What is Paintball PVP?</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Paintball PVP is a Minecraft server that features a survival PVP server. You are put in a random world each game and you fight until the last man standing.</p>
			<p>It is called 'Paintball' because snowballs will actually take 2 hearts off the person/animal upon being hit. Each kill will get you a score on your profile, vise-versa for player deaths as well.</p>	
			<p>If you win a PVP match, you get a <strong>cake</strong> the next time you play a server! The server will then restart with a new map for you.</p>

			<h4>What are kits?</h4>
			<br>
			<p>The kits is what you choose when you first join the server. Upon server start, you will get given items from which the kits you choose. These kit choices depend on the type of person you are what you think you'll get the most out of them.</p>
			<p>An example of a kit choise is if you think you are better are better with a bow, choose archer, or if you think you are better at defense, choose thor.</p>

			<h4>When you first join</h4>
			<br>
			<p>When you join the server, you will have the ability to spectate the map around you. This will come in handy for anyone to spot any caves, trees and places to hide. Keep in mind that while you spectate you cannot hit animals and players.</p>
			<p>After the spectate timer has stopped, you have 3 minutes to prepare yourself, within these 3 minutes you are hidden from everyone else and they are also hidden from you. You are expected to create a defense while preparing.</p>
			<p>After the prepare timer is stopped, you are given 5 stacks of snowballs and 45 minutes until the game ends and map resets.</p>

			<h4>Tracking</h4>
			<br>
			<p>With each server join you get a compass. This compass will allow you to track players. By right clicking the compass you can see who you will be tracking. When you get within 30 blocks of a user you will get a message saying "Your target is close."</p>
